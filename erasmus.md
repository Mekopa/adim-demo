## Activities

All the activities of a Small-scale Partnership must take place in the countries of the organisations participating in the project. In addition, if duly justified in relation to the objectives or implementation of the project, activities can also take place at the seat of an Institution of the European Union, even if in the project there are no participating organisations from the country that hosts the Institution.

You are asked to provide information about each planned activity as a whole (e.g. its venue, duration, etc.), to define the activity’s lead organisation, and optionally to list the other participating organisations. The lead organisation is typically the one organising the activity. The other participating organisations are all other project partners who will also take part in the particular activity. The estimated activity start and end dates can be changed during implementation.

Please include in the section below all planned activities and indicate the grant amount allocated to each one. Keep in mind that the total amount should be equal to the Project lump sum requested.
